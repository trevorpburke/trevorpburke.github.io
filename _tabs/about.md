Hello, there! :wave:

My name is Trevor. I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco. 

I plan to write about homelab stuff and about the wild, varied world of infrastructure engineering. Might also talk about bikes, public transit, crabbing, or anything else that's on my mind. 

Feel free to send me an email anytime `trevorpburke+blog@gmail.com`
